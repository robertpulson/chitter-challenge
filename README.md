# chitter-challenge

An exercise using Sinatra to build a twitter clone.

# Key Learning Areas

* Sinatra
* PostSQL
* Relationships

# Progress

I was able to code a solution which incorporated a lot of the functionality of Twitter. Users can create an account, sign in and out and post tweets. However there are still areas that require some work.

# Future enhancements

* Work on css/html
* Add likes and comments
* Add user area, with profile, etc.

`bundle install` will install all the required gems.

You can then use `rackup` and paste `localhost:9292` into your browser to try the site out.

I think; therefore I am...
